This project will modernize the code base and accelerate the migration of five of HUDâ€™s most critical business systems from an on-premise mainframe database to the cloud. Both the existing mainframe and the five COBOL-based applications are expensive to maintain and currently require functional system enhancements to be built in the antiquated mainframe environment, deepening the technical debt associated with the eventual decommissioning of the platform.

The new modern platform will be a Java cloud-based application suite that costs less to maintain and enables functional and technical enhancements to be completed more rapidly, at lower cost. The systems on the current on-premises physical hardware environment support 30,000 users for more than 100 HUD grant, subsidy, and loan programs that disburse $27 billion per year. According to HUD estimates, the code modernization and migration will save $8 million annually, enabling payback and generating working capital to transform additional legacy systems.

Without this funding, the Department would likely not have the resources to pursue this project for several years due to funding limitations. However, with support from the Technology Modernization Fund the project is estimated to be completed in two years.
