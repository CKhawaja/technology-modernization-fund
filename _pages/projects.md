Below are the current public\*  projects, including project-specific descriptions and the information necessary to meet statutory requirements.

\**Details on classified projects are not included below. If you have questions about a classified project, please contact [tmf@gsa.gov](mailto:tmf@gsa.gov).* 

## The American Rescue Plan (ARP)

The [American Rescue Plan provided $1 billion in TMF funds]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/arp.md %}) to address urgent IT modernization challenges, bolster cybersecurity defenses, and respond to the COVID-19 crisis. The TMF Board has prioritized funding projects that cut across agencies, address immediate security gaps, and improve the public’s ability to access services.

These investments are directly responsive to the president's Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity, and include funding the transformation of three critical agencies in the executive branch. These projects aim to strengthen the security of data and privacy protections for 2M civilian federal employees whose data is housed in the Office of Personnel Management's systems, the over 100M students and borrowers the Department of Education supports, and hundreds of facilities under the control of the General Services Administration.

With Login.gov and MAX.gov, these investments will transform authentication for the federal government through shared services, providing for easy multi-factor authentication and an improved experience for millions of users. These investments are also directly responsive to the COVID-19 pandemic that has fundamentally changed how the federal government operates and interacts with the public. MAX.gov aims to improve interagency cooperation and communication, which is critical in a remote and hybrid environment, and the Department of Homeland Security aims to address issues uncovered by moving paper processes digitally and streamlining communications between agencies, improving their ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## PERM Visa Modernization 

{% include project-data.html path="dol_perm_visa" %}
The PERM Visa Modernization project at the Department of Labor (DOL) will make it easier, faster, and cheaper for employers to access permanent labor certification services and create a more seamless immigrant visa processing experience with the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and State (DOS). Specifically, it will integrate a modernized PERM labor certification process into DOL’s Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) digital platform, which uses GSA’s Login.gov services and enables the secure and efficient sharing of labor certification data across the multi-agency visa processing life cycle through its Interagency DataHub technology.

DOL processes nearly 120,000 requests for permanent labor certification across 73,000 unique employers annually. More than 68% of PERM applications request labor certification in STEM related jobs, and significant delays in processing may adversely affect the foreign worker’s ability to remain in the U.S and the employer’s ability to retain skilled talent. Employers seeking access to DOL permanent labor certification services currently face an outdated and fragmented sign-in and business verification process that is inefficient and challenging to navigate, redundant data collection and application filing requirements, multiple manual workarounds for agency staff, and lengthy labor certification documents that must be printed, signed, and mailed to DHS. The current system causes a poor customer experience for digitally accessing permanent labor certification services, inconsistent case processing times, unnecessary administrative costs for employers and government agencies, and increased fraud and security risks.

With TMF funding and support, DOL will transform three processes: the process for PERM filers to submit applications, the process for PERM analysts to review applications, and the process to submit PERM labor certification decisions to USCIS and DOS. DOL has re-engineered its business processes to eliminate manual and paper-based processes. PERM modernization will enable PERM analysts to create and issue correspondence to filers, to automate the audit selection process for integrity reviews and to access data on problematic employers. DOL anticipates a reduction in the adjudication cycle time by approximately 45 days, a cost savings of $1.5 million annually for PERM filers, and cost avoidance of $2.2 million annually related to the elimination of paper-based processes, the reduction of office
space/physical document storage, and the redirection of staff from manual work to higher-value adjudication work.

## Grant Management Modernization

{% include project-data.html path="americorps-grant-manage-mod" %}

This investment will deliver simple, secure, effective, and responsive digital solutions for more than 2,800 local, nonprofit, faith, and community-based organizations applying for funding or managing their existing federal national service grants. It will also improve customer experience for approximately 250,000 individuals from more than 40,000 communities that AmeriCorps engages in results-driven service. 

The current system, developed in 2002, cannot effectively integrate with other federal systems or user engagement tools, lacks modern business intelligence capabilities to manage grants, and significantly restricts AmeriCorps’ ability to meet its mission, keep pace with the current grant-making standards and technical needs, and appropriately steward agency resources. 

With TMF funding and support, AmeriCorps will modernize its information technology infrastructure, reduce barriers to accessing AmeriCorps resources, expand the agency’s ability to recruit and retain new organizations, and support more than 1,300 existing grantees. With a modern, agile system, AmeriCorps will be able to react quickly and efficiently as community and national challenges arise.

AmeriCorps has formalized a partnership with the Grants Quality Service Management Office (QSMO) at the Department of Health and Human Services to capture new and emerging practices that can enhance federal grants management while providing value to other agencies. By replacing a legacy system that no longer meets user needs, AmeriCorps will be able to integrate these new and emerging federal grants practices, while significantly improving the agency’s ability to secure protected data. This system will underpin AmeriCorps’ complementary modernization initiatives designed to ensure that every American over 18 has an equitable opportunity to participate in national service and that US community-based organizations can benefit from national service resources.

## USAID Zero Trust Architecture 

{% include project-data.html path="usaid-zero-trust" %}
As a global enterprise, every technology asset, whether an application, laptop, desktop, server, or other device, represents both an opportunity and a risk for USAID. The “anywhere, anytime” access required by a global organization, coupled with the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, pushed the USAID network beyond the traditional perimeter boundary controls and left gaps in security such as remote identity proofing, privileged access management, and strong authentication assurance levels.

With the support of the TMF, USAID can accelerate funding for its Zero Trust initiatives and can advance the development timeline earlier, from FY 2025 to FY 2024.  By the end of the project, USAID will have a modern identity management system that addresses the business problem by providing sufficient artifacts to meet Federal audit levels and compliance, as well as enhanced identity controls that permit USAID's cybersecurity teams to dynamically govern USAID user access to systems/applications/networks uniformly, regardless of user location. This will provide a greater degree of protection for the agency’s cyber assets and improve the work experience of 13,000+ end users around the world by consolidating identities, modernizing authentication, providing password-less technology, and expanding the Agency’s secure work for “anytime, anywhere” access.

USAID’s planned capabilities are centered around five Zero Trust Architecture pillars - Identity, Devices, Networks, Applications & Workloads, and Data. TMF’s investment will support the Identity pillar projects under which USAID plans to complete next-generation Multifactor Authentication and Automation/Dynamic Access Control pilots in FY 2022 and complete the design and implementation in FY 2023. This will enable USAID to start transitioning users to the new identity management system in FY 2023. By FY 2024, USAID anticipates over 50% of users will be transitioned to the new Identity Management system.

## Network Modernization

{% include project-data.html path="usda-usdanet" %}
This investment by the TMF in the U.S. Department of Agriculture Network Modernization (USDANet) will deliver an updated, 21st-Century network that enables the USDA to better serve its customers over the next decade and beyond. The current network faces challenges in keeping up with expanded program needs for throughput and security.  With the support of the TMF, the USDA network will greatly improve reliability so that all USDA Mission Areas can meet their program needs. This investment will be used for the USDANet startup costs that reduces the number of USDA-owned and operated networks from 17 to 1 and will result in $734 million in estimated costs savings/avoidance.

Mission Areas like the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which delivers critical food safety data to industry, academia and the public through the Public Health Information System (PHIS), will benefit from faster, more consistent implementation of new security policies. USDANet will offer improved network security and a faster path to Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 standards and Zero-Trust Architectures. This is critical in preventing cyber-attacks to operations in programs such as the Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services which are responsible for the management, security, and distribution of $122 billion in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for American families experiencing food insecurity.

The lowered total cost of ownership by the USDA means Mission Areas can allocate greater portions of their IT spending from basic infrastructure to public-facing applications that promote conservation, goodwill, and optimization of resources. It also enables USDA’s mission to provide economic opportunity through innovation, promotion of agricultural production that nourishes Americans while also feeding others throughout the world, and preserving our natural resources through conservation, restored forests, improved watersheds, smart agriculture, and healthy private working lands.

## Multi-Cloud Security Operations Center

{% include project-data.html path="ftc-multi-cloud-socaas" %}
This project will keep sensitive law enforcement, corporate competition filing, and American consumer data more secure and resilient to attack. FTC collects data from thousands of corporate merger filings and millions of consumer fraud complaints every year. Along with U.S. and International law enforcement partners, the FTC uses this data to promote competition and protect consumers. The data is under increasingly sophisticated attacks from multiple adversaries.

To accomplish the project’s goal the FTC will procure a security operations center (SOC) as a service that modernizes existing government SOCs and allows for faster decision-making, a reduced vulnerability attack surface, and an improved repeatable foundation for future government-wide implementations of SOC as a Service (SOCaaS). The agency’s current SOC approach, like many others in government, is built for government operated data centers that don’t efficiently scale to address increasing numbers of alerts. 

With the support of this TMF investment, the FTC will expedite its SOCaaS implementation using security services and trusted cloud service providers to host sensitive FTC data. This comprehensive approach will greatly reduce the risk of bad actors executing a ransomware or other cyber attack. It will also reduce the number of man hours currently expended to respond to indicators of cyber incidents. These hours could then be repurposed to continue improvements to the agency’s many operational systems for merger filing review and reporting of fraud. The agency is collaborating on this effort with other federal cyber security leaders, 
including the Department of Homeland Security, to share best practices.

## Information Sharing Modernization

{% include project-data.html path="dhs-info-sharing-mod" %}
This project will help modernize DHS’ Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) service to develop an updated and more secure platform for information sharing among first responders, law enforcement, and government partners in the event of natural disasters, security events, and other crises.

Information sharing has been a core mission of DHS since its founding. Fulfilling that mission involves delivering timely intelligence and enabling real-time collaboration across a large and diverse number of organizations including federal, state, local, territorial, tribal, international, and private sector decision-makers, and first responders. HSIN played a pivotal role during the COVID-19 pandemic supporting coordination with hundreds of organizations for vaccine distribution, providing information, and coordinating operations. The network was used by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Fusion Centers, as well as additional state and local partners, putting unprecedented pressure on DHS’s decade-old information sharing network and exposing limitations in its ability to manage growth in excess of 200% during the height of the pandemic.

With TMF funding and support, DHS plans to rebuild its information sharing system as a cloud native platform with modern tools and technologies. The new platform will be capable of scaling up to meet peaks in demand during times of emergency while also offering significant new features including improved access and security; better content sharing and discoverability; and greater emphasis on connecting HSIN’s partners to each other for closer collaboration. DHS will also use the TMF investment to build a platform that is more responsive to a post pandemic work environment for users with easy and secure access on mobile platforms and other
devices.

This investment will accelerate DHS’ modernization of a system that is core to its mission. A system that is more flexible, offers a better user experience, and is less costly to maintain. The operational benefits of this project include building a stronger community of federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, international, and private sector partners for closer coordination, more effective emergency response, and improved national security.

## High Value Asset Mission Essential Systems

{% include project-data.html path="nara-hva-sys" %}
This project will digitize and transform the National Archives and Records Administration’s (NARA) paper-based fulfillment processes for citizen records requests, allowing for rapid retrieval and delivery of electronic copies of records to the public and other government agencies through secure, accessible web portals.

NARA serves as the nation’s record keeper, holding federal records dating back to the American Revolution. These include veterans’ military service and medical records as well as billions of other citizen records. Each year, NARA receives approximately 1.1 million records requests from veterans and their families who need to access benefits, as well as nearly 8 million records requests from over 400 Federal agencies that need to provide citizen services and fulfill their missions.

Nearly all of these requested records are only available on paper, stored in records facilities located across the country. COVID-19 put significant pressure on these operations, limiting onsite processing capacity, creating a backlog of hundreds of thousands of records requests, and highlighting the need for a more responsive and modern record delivery process.

With TMF investment and support, NARA will replace its legacy case management, reporting, and records information systems with cloud-based platforms. Among other benefits, this investment will allow veterans and their families to electronically request and receive their records, while supporting agency customers with greater responsiveness as they transition toward digital recordkeeping. It will also allow NARA staff to fulfill records requests remotely, fully digitally, and in a secure fashion.

This project’s benefits include major improvements in customer experience, decreased processing time for records requests, and improved resilience in the face of future disruptions. By ensuring that NARA can provide Federal records more quickly and reliably, this TMF investment will help citizens to better exercise their rights and more quickly access government benefits to which they are due.

## Network Monitoring, Detection, and Response

{% include project-data.html path="usda-net-monitoring" %}
This project will improve the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) threat monitoring, detection and response capabilities. This investment will help USDA move toward implementing a Zero Trust Architecture, better secure its shared services and sensitive data, and protect Department websites that connect citizens to vital services.

USDA’s nearly 100,000 employees are spread across more than 4,500 locations across the country and abroad. Its 29 agencies and bureaus do critical work in areas ranging from rural development and forest management to nutrition programs, agricultural research, and international trade. It also houses the National Finance Center (NFC), which provides payroll services for over 600,000 employees and financial services for more than 40 agencies across the federal government. These vital functions all generate large volumes of sensitive information that require safeguarding. The SolarWinds attack underscored the need for enhanced response capabilities at USDA and across the government.

With the TMF funding and support, USDA will implement a set of new software tools to improve USDA’s cybersecurity posture. These include applications that will enhance automated threat hunting and detection, improve visibility of encrypted network traffic, and reduce risks. Once implemented, this project will dramatically improve USDA’s ability to prevent, detect, and remediate any network intrusions at USDA and contribute to the security of the Federal enterprise. It will also allow USDA to deploy tools to protect its public-facing websites, ensuring that the public can reliably access information about farm loans, nutrition assistance, food safety inspections, and other key USDA offerings. These improvements will allow the agency to meet its obligations laid out in the Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

## Veteran Identity Modernization

{% include project-data.html path="va-id-mod" %}
This project will make it faster, cheaper, and easier for veterans to access VA services and benefits. Specifically, it will modernize the sign-in experience at VA, allowing eligible veterans to digitally access benefits and services more reliably and securely with Login.gov.

VA digital services are used by millions of veterans every month. Veterans seeking to access VA services currently face a fragmented sign-in process that is confusing and hard to use – there are currently multiple sign-in pathways and four credential options with differing levels of compliance, security, and usability. This results in a poor user experience for digitally accessing benefits and services, high costs of licensing duplicative credentials, and increased fraud and security risks. 

With TMF funding and support, VA will take three steps towards the implementation of a single, modern, and easy to use sign-in service at VA. First, this project will support the seamless transition of existing users to Login.gov. Second, VA will create an in-person identity verification option for veterans unable to sign up online. Finally, VA will pilot physical security keys for multi-factor authentication to improve accessibility and make digital services more secure. This investment will not only improve the experience of veterans accessing VA benefits and services, but also reduce VA costs and the risk of fraud.

## IT Modernization

{% include project-data.html path="prc_it_mod" %}
This project will modernize the Postal Regulatory Commission’s (PRC) website, docket, and data analysis tools, allowing the public to more easily access and participate in the Commission’s proceedings and equipping the PRC staff with the resources to more efficiently and effectively execute on its goal of providing transparent and effective oversight of the US Postal Service’s (USPS) operations.

The PRC is a small agency with a big mission: independent oversight of the USPS, a global operation that delivered over 128 billion pieces of mail, including over 7 billion packages in FY 2021, and operates more than 34 thousand post offices. The pandemic, workforce shortages, and supply chain disruptions have posed urgent new challenges for the postal system and its ability to provide efficient and effective mail delivery for the American people. These developments and a surge in interest in postal matters have challenged the PRC’s capacity to carry out its mission of ensuring transparency and accountability of the Postal Service and fostering a vital and efficient universal mail system. These new demands have put significant pressure on PRC’s public facing website and docket system. This system is over 20 years old and is at imminent risk of failure. An antiquated data environment and analysis tools also force PRC economists to conduct analyses of massive volumes of data manually, hindering PRC’s ability to quickly and appropriately scale up oversight efforts to address the multiplying challenges.

With TMF funding and support, the PRC team plans to replace its systems with cloud-based applications. The team will develop three key platforms: a new public-facing website, a modern docket system, and a data management system. This investment will empower PRC with the tools it needs to ensure that the USPS remains effective and responsive to the public in the face of unprecedented challenges. The operational benefits of this project include faster and more thorough analysis of data, a more navigable and user-friendly website, and reduced operation and maintenance costs.

## Registration and Verification Modernization

{% include project-data.html path="sss_reg_ver_mod" %}

This project aims to modernize Selective Service System’s (SSS) Registration, Compliance, and Verification (RCV) software to improve the resiliency of the application and enable the Agency to rapidly scale their technical operations to meet the nation's needs.

The SSS is a small agency charged with registering all male U.S. citizens and male immigrants residing in the United States between the ages of 18 and 25. The agency’s registry is critical in the event of any national emergency requiring a mobilization for national defense. Annually, the SSS’s team of 115 manages over two million selective service registrations and approximately six million enrollment verification checks. This registration data also provides eligibility verification for student aid, over four million Federal civilian and local government jobs, free job training, and a potential streamlined process for citizenship. 

The Agency will use this investment to migrate RCV to a cloud-first software and data architecture, enhance its cybersecurity protection and performance capabilities, and improve the application’s public-facing user experience. RCV, a High Value Asset (HVA), will be redesigned to a new modern architecture featuring continuous availability from redundant geographic locations, enhanced protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and advanced data analytics, helping the Agency leverage registrant data to make timely and informed decisions that will ensure the fairness and equity of any future mobilization. Through this work, the project will transform the agency’s technical operations to both maintain a steady state of readiness, and to scale up rapidly when activated by Congress and the President.

Operational benefits of this project include enhanced cybersecurity protections, reduced maintenance costs, improved system resiliency, and rapid operational scalability. The TMF is well-positioned to deliver rapid, timely funding for mission-critical modernization projects to small agencies like the SSS, and is excited for this project to further the federal government’s mission to strengthen cybersecurity and improve service delivery to the nation.

## Zero Trust Networking

{% include project-data.html path="opm-zero-trust-network" %}

This project will accelerate the agency’s adoption of a zero trust cybersecurity architecture strategy. As the Human Resources (HR) provider for the Federal Government, OPM manages extremely sensitive personal data for millions of current and retired Federal employees. Using TMF funds, this project will implement zero trust solutions across the 5 main zero trust pillars: 1) Identity, 2) Devices and Endpoint, 3) Network and Environment, 4) Application Workload, and 5) Data. This effort will reduce OPM’s attack surface and increase cybersecurity protections, visibility, and the resiliency of their services.
 
This project will enable OPM to fully comply with the mandates established in the Executive Order on “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.” Furthermore, implementing zero trust will provide OPM with additional identity management options for enhanced collaboration with agency partners. The operational benefits of this project include reducing the number of security tools required to monitor and maintain an effective cybersecurity program, cost savings, and improved interagency communications and collaboration efforts. By the end of this project, OPM will achieve significant progress on their journey to achieve an Optimal level in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Zero Trust Maturity Model.

## Zero Trust Architecture 

{% include project-data.html path="ed-zero-trust-architecture" %}

This project will allow the U.S. Department of Education (ED) to create and fully implement a zero trust architecture plan across the enterprise to increase the security of the citizen data the department maintains.
 
Using TMF funds, ED will enact a zero trust program over a span of two years that includes strategy, architecture, design, and an implementation roadmap. ED will also establish a catalog of services with Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) technologies. The department will stand up an enterprise-wide program management office dedicated to zero trust as well as adopt an advanced architecture across cloud-computing environments in accordance with the developed roadmap. By improving and modernizing cybersecurity technologies the Department will provide more secure and less burdensome user experiences both for employees and the public.
 
---

## Advancing Zero Trust

{% include project-data.html path="gsa-advancing-zero-trust" %}

This project will allow the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) to modernize legacy network systems and implement an advanced zero trust architecture (ZTA).
 
Using TMF Funds, GSA will advance their cybersecurity architecture by focusing on three blocks: Users and Devices, Networks, and Security Operations. Within the first block, GSA will replace directory designs to meet the newer demands of telework and a multi-domain, hybrid cloud architecture approach with virtualization adhering to enhanced security principles. GSA will also develop a modernized enterprise single-sign-on (SSO) to include new multi-factor authentication options. In the second block, GSA will focus on microsegmentation by leveraging a secure access service edge (SASE) solution and upgrading their public buildings’ security network. Lastly, GSA will adopt increased machine learning and artificial intelligence driven algorithms to help connect diverse data sources and highlight threats while providing security oversight for cyber supply chain risk management and enhancing core security operations centers to include governmentwide public-facing digital services. 
 
By implementing these modernization efforts, GSA will improve user experience through seamless global connection to GSA-managed environments and applications while maintaining ZTA principles. It will improve cybersecurity capabilities to continually verify the security of users, devices, applications, and data as well as achieve broad-based visibility across the GSA ecosystem with enhanced capabilities leveraging automation to manage and respond to threats in real-time.

## Login.gov

{% include project-data.html path="gsa-login-gov" %}

This project will allow the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) to further scale the Login.gov shared service with more advanced cybersecurity capabilities, expand identity verification coverage, and expand integrations with agency public-facing digital services.
 
Login.gov is a secure sign-in service used by over 30+ million citizens and businesses to access over 200 services spanning 27 federal agencies. A shared identity service like Login.gov is critical for reducing government costs, providing a seamless user experience to individuals, and ensuring the privacy and protection of user data. While the initial launch and adoption of Login.gov have been successful, additional support is required to expand and accommodate the requirements of all federal agencies, to reach a significantly broader segment of the public, and to achieve a sustainable cost-model without cost being a barrier to entry for individual agencies. Additionally, one of the primary goals of these funds is to provide accessible and equitable capabilities that can be used by underserved and vulnerable populations that traditionally have experienced barriers to online or digital services.
 
The TMF funding will serve three purposes. First, it will increase cybersecurity identification and protection for current and future users. Second, it will add equitable identity verification and in-person options for vulnerable populations. Third, it will grow the Login.gov environment by reducing the barrier to entry for agencies to allow for Login.gov to increase usage to a higher percentage of citizen participation. The operational benefits of this project include increasing identity verification services, reducing fraud, expanding access to digital services for millions of citizens, and reducing government-wide costs at scale.

## Southwest Border Technology Integration Program

{% include project-data.html path="dhs-southwest-border-technology" %}

This project allows the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to use data and technology to more efficiently, effectively, and humanely process noncitizens encountered at our Southwest Border.

Southwest Border processing involves multiple DHS Components and partner agencies, each operating on independent data systems and many key handoffs still taking place with paper files. The Southwest Border Technology Integration Program (TIP) will provide standardized and secure data sharing across the Federal enterprise and throughout the immigration lifecycle to improve border flow and capacity management and increase the timeliness and fidelity of data used by decision makers. This project will connect disparate systems, improve cross-agency collaboration, and support data-driven decision-making.

---

## MAX.gov Transition

{% include project-data.html path="gsa-max-gov-transition" %}

This project allows the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) project to enhance MAX.gov to provide a modernized, secure cloud-based solution for cross-agency collaboration, authentication, and other shared services capabilities.
 
MAX.gov usage has significantly increased in the 14 years since its deployment, and dozens of agencies rely on the system for mission critical operations. MAX.gov is currently at a critical juncture where the technology is outdated and increased demand is affecting scalability. The current system is scheduled to be decommissioned in FY23, which would leave customers without the technology resources needed to execute mission functions.
 
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) transitioned the program to GSA’s Technology Transformation Services (TTS) to continue to support 73 partner agencies while enhancing and expanding collaboration technologies to the rest of the government. The MAX.gov Transition Project Management Office (PMO) within TTS is charged with creating modern cloud-based authentication and collaboration products for government organizations on a fee-for-service basis. This will allow government organizations to continue to deliver on their missions when working across organizational boundaries.

## UNISYS Mainframe Migration

{% include project-data.html path="hud_unisys" %}

This project modernizes the codebase and accelerates the migration of five of HUD’s most critical business systems from an on-premise mainframe database to the cloud. Both the existing mainframe and the five COBOL-based applications were expensive to maintain and required functional system enhancements to be built in an antiquated mainframe environment, deepening the technical debt associated with the eventual decommissioning of the platform.

The new modern platform is a Java and cloud-based application suite that costs less to maintain and update, enabling functional and technical enhancements to be completed more rapidly. These systems support 30,000 users for more than 100 HUD grant, subsidy, and loan programs that disburse $27 billion per year. According to HUD estimates, the code modernization and migration will save $8 million annually, allowing funds to transform additional legacy systems.

Securing a TMF investment served as a catalyst inside the Department and led to garnering strong support for this project at all levels of the organization. As a result, HUD leadership allocated additional internal funds to accelerate the project, reduce the amount needed from the TMF, and still achieve the full benefits of the original proposal. With TMF’s ongoing support and an investment of $13,850,013, the project aims to be complete in FY 22.

## Enterprise Cloud Email

{% include project-data.html path="doe_email" %}

Maintaining multiple on-premises email environments not only drives up agency costs, but also increases the enterprise’s threat vector. Before starting this project, DOE operated 64 separate email systems (of which 45 were on-premises) that serviced approximately 184,387 mailboxes across the Department. Since FY 2018, DOE has completed moving 14 on-premises systems to cloud email, decommissioned one system, and established internally funded migration plans for 12 additional systems. DOE has been able to enhance its cybersecurity posture, reduce IT management and maintenance costs, and provide employees with a more robust email platform while migrating its email infrastructure to the cloud.  While the focus was on email migration, this project provides DOE residual benefits.  By leveraging Office 365 G5 licensing it not only supported DOE’s email requirements but the inherit capabilities within the Microsoft offering includes multiple collaboration capabilities (i.e., Teams, One Drive for Business) These capabilities will allow DOE to remove existing lines of demarcation and facilitate efficient, streamlined communications throughout the enterprise.  

The Department originally requested $15,217,096 to complete the consolidation, upgrade, and migration effort for 26 on-premises systems (out of 45). The Department’s decision to pursue TMF funding served as a catalyst to garner support from federated labs and field offices, and enabled several DOE components to secure internal funding and move forward with migration efforts independently. DOE also identified 2,201 mailboxes that can be decommissioned, rather than migrated, due to the elimination of secondary email systems and other efficiencies. Due to the success of these efforts and additional internal investment, DOE completed the project with a reduced TMF funding amount of $2.4 million dollars. The project kicked off in Q4 2018 and over the project lifecycle they have successfully migrated all [XX] mailboxes to the cloud.
 
Without this funding, DOE would have had to conduct the migration using a piecemeal approach requiring an elongated migration timeline.  With support from the TMF, the project was tackled as a single effort which accelerated the overall migration effort. The operational benefits of this project include cost avoidance, increased efficiency, improved cyber posture, and decreased operational risk.

## Farmers.gov Customer Experience Portal

{% include project-data.html path="usda_portal" %}

This project began in July 2018 and was closed out in May 2021. 

In 2017, USDA established the Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) mission area that encompasses the work of the Farm Service Agency (FSA), the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the Risk Management Agency (RMA). Both FSA and NRCS provide financial and technical assistance to farmers and ranchers through related conservation programs. In an effort to consolidate interconnected systems and improve the end user experience, the Department planned to update and modernize conservation financial assistance and payment operations systems across FSA and NRCS. 

In just under 2 years, USDA developed a proof of concept that integrated disparate enrollment processes into a consolidated Farmers.gov Citizen Experience Portal. With a $4,000,000 investment from the TMF, USDA documented both current and proposed processes, identified and developed four robotics process operations (RPA) demonstration tools, and developed a proof of concept to test a shared enrollment process across FSA and NRCS. Through this work, the Department identified future alignment needs between different policies and processes and demonstrated how robotic process automation capabilities could be used in different business areas to create process efficiencies.

## Labor Certificate Processing Modernization

{% include project-data.html path="dol_visa" %}

This project began in January 2019 and was completed in April 2021. 
 
Prior to this project, the Department of Labor (DOL) used an outdated paper-based process to issue Labor Certifications to employer applicants for certain types of work visas. This process required both specialized printing on costly security paper and employer applicants and representatives to manually mail Labor Certifications and other relevant documents to the Department of Homeland Security U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) as part of their visa application.
 
Without this investment, DOL would need to continuously maintain and require the use of paper-based form processing, adding time and friction to a critical workflow. With the support of the TMF and its investment of $3,500,000, the project team eliminated the need for both the DOL and the employer applicant to mail Labor Certification forms back and forth and to USCIS.
 
Over the course of two years, the team used an agile approach to improve systems, enabling the Department to securely issue Labor Certifications electronically through an “E-Certification” document, similar to the electronic boarding passes issued by airlines. In addition, this project streamlined and improved data accessibility and reporting capabilities by creating a data hub at the Department to securely transmit the Labor Certification and other necessary documentation to USCIS, giving agencies direct access to case files. In November 2020, the Department successfully transitioned the Labor Certification process for all types of visas from paper to digital “E-Certification”, producing an estimated annual cost avoidance of $2,000,000 in supplies and labor, increasing efficiency, and improving a painful end-user experience. This work eliminated an artificial barrier to the number of certifications that could be issued daily, allowing the Department to issue 176% more H-2A certifications and 109% more H-2B certifications in a single day.   It also gave farmers and employers immediate access to their certifications, saving them costly trips away from the farm to sign and mail documents.

## Application Modernization Integrating Flexible Architectures

{% include project-data.html path="gsa_appmod" %}

In 2018, GSA had 88 IT applications in need of modernization. The applications had cumbersome, outdated user interfaces and were difficult to connect to other systems. Despite the need for transformation, GSA would have had to modernize legacy systems in a piecemeal fashion, as funding became available in annual budgets. With the support of the TMF and its investment of $7,808,563.00, the team could pursue a full and faster transformation of all planned applications, including at the hardware, database, and application layers. 
 
Over the course of three years, GSA used a cross-functional Solutions Team with a deep understanding of the applications’ technical specifications and employed best-in-class agile methodologies. The team created a set of standard target technologies for all future application migrations. They generated various playbooks (Database Transformation and Sensitive Data Migration) that have already guided the modernization of 10 additional GSA applications and are accessible to all other government agencies.  This TMF project ultimately enabled GSA to develop greater agility, resiliency, scalability, and performance. In addition, it also allowed GSA greater flexibility in recruiting talent. In the long term, these outcomes promise to lower the cost of operations, improve the quality of GSA applications, and establish a repeatable process for modernizing legacy applications that can be leveraged across the government enterprise.

## Infrastructure Optimization and Cloud Adoption

{% include project-data.html path="usda_ck10" %}

This project began in November 2018 and was completed in April 2020. 
 
In 2018, USDA had mission critical applications that were riddled with system performance issues and security challenges, as well as a decentralized IT infrastructure that was costly to maintain and upgrade. Ten critical applications were hosted on costly mission area-specific data centers, resulting in poor enterprise adoption of cloud services and a lack of expertise to maintain them. With the support of the TMF and its investment of $500,000, USDA worked with the GSA Cloud Centers of Excellence to develop their approach and the project represented the beginning of a continuous cloud-enablement across USDA.
 
This project enabled the Department to consolidate their cloud expertise and leverage it enterprise-wide. It also served as a catalyst inside the Department to generate buy-in from USDA’s agencies and components for this approach. Due to the strong support for this project at all levels of the organization generated by the TMF investment, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) secured internal funding to move forward with a migration of five applications. With the support of the TMF, USDA completed the migration of the Emergency Watershed Protection application in the Farm Production and Conservation portfolio, improving functionality and generating cost savings used to repay the TMF. Leveraging TMF funds allowed USDA to migrate a critical application to the cloud, conduct additional application rationalization efforts using established best practices, and set an example of how cloud migration could be tackled successfully across the agency.

## NewPay Payroll and Work Schedule and Leave Management Software-as-a-Service

{% include project-data.html path="gsa_newpay" %}

This project began in December 2018 and was closed out in July 2021. 

Federal payroll operations commonly rely on decades-old legacy software, which is costly and difficult to maintain. With support from the TMF, GSA created a minimum viable product (MVP) to address this need by leveraging software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions, with the aim of laying a new foundation for an enterprise solution for human resource functions government wide. During the development of the MVP, GSA received the designation of Quality Service Management Office (QSMO) for Civilian HR Transaction Services for payroll and work schedule and leave management (WSLM), providing operational support for compensation management, work schedule, and leave management services. The HR QSMO continues to partner and collaborate with stakeholder groups, both withinOPM and across the federal human resources (HR) community, in the development of data standards to support the implementation of modern technical solutions within the Civilian HR Transactions marketplace.

GSA originally requested $20,650,000 for this NewPay project to develop a software-as-a-service solution (SaaS) and related interfaces for payroll and WSLM. GSA and other agencies requested Congressional appropriations in FY 2019 and FY 2020 to conduct planning and migration activities for the Payroll Shared Service Providers and agencies to migrate to the NewPay solution; however, the requested funding was not granted. As a result, and given the uncertain timing of agency migrations to the new tool, the agency revised and reduced the project scope and funding required. The project was completed after designing and configuring the NewPay payroll solution for 65 pay plans and completed verification testing for 12 of the most common plans, at a reduced cost of under $8M. With the support from the TMF, the project was able to stand up initial payroll capabilities for Title 5 employees and provide a tool that demonstrates how federal HR standards and regulations can be applied in the context of a commercial SaaS solution to improve key HR functions such as payroll operations in a federal environment.

## Charge and Case Management System Modernization

{% include project-data.html path="eeoc_casemgmt" %}

This project will accelerate the modernization of EEOC’s charge and case management system. Currently, EEOC’s charge and case management program is running on an outdated and slow backbone system that relies heavily on costly proprietary technologies and requires the use of precise alphanumeric codes, rather than plain language, to record case information for the more than 200,000 inquiries reviewed by the agency each year. This project will allow for faster, more efficient review of cases and will reduce the costs of operating the system. 

EEOC anticipates it will have a greater ability to serve its mission by improving the basic functionality of its core charge and case management system, which will not only make EEOC's private and public sector operations more efficient but also benefit the Fair Employment Practice Agencies that rely on EEOC's system to manage their cases. In addition, applicants and employees seeking assistance from EEOC will be able to take advantage of end-to-end digital processing of their charges. 

Without this funding, EEOC would need to complete this project over a period of five years. However, with the support from the TMF the project can be conducted in FY 2020 to FY 2022 as a single effort to replace the legacy system. By the end of this project, EEOC will have a modern, cloud-based core charge and case management system that will modernize both the underlying technology and achieve operational efficiencies that will decrease its current software licensing expenses and reduce other existing development and maintenance expenditures. The operational benefits of this project include increased efficiency, cost savings and improved citizen services.

## Agricultural Marketing Service Specialty Crops System Modernization

{% include project-data.html path="usda_spc" %}

This project will accelerate the modernization of the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Specialty Crops Program billing, inspection, and certificate generation and issuance processes that support the inspection and certification of more than 10.7 billion pounds of processed fruit and vegetable products and 49.9 billion pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables. This includes 1.2 billion pounds of fresh and processed fruit and vegetable items valued at more than $713 million for domestic feeding programs (school lunches) and 7,183 lots, or 410 million servings, of military combat rations at 18 processing plants nationwide and in American Samoa to ensure the quality of the military’s food components.

Currently, USDA AMS’s billing, inspection, and certificate generation and issuance processes are managed through a combination of inefficient manual, paper-based processes and legacy information technology systems that are outdated and difficult to maintain. This project will allow the Specialty Crops Inspection program to modernize its systems and processes by moving the agency to a cloud-based solution that leverages existing commercial products and offerings. Moreover, this project will facilitate a cultural transformation in the Specialty Crops Inspection program, streamlining, standardizing, and modernizing the underlying processes that support this important work.

Without this funding, USDA would need to complete this project gradually over a period of five years. However, with the support from the TMF the project can be conducted as a single effort and be completed by FY 2022. By the end of this project, USDA will have a modern, holistic system for its billing, inspection, and certificate generation and issuance processes that will enable AMS Specialty Crops inspectors, front-line managers, and other users to comprehensively and securely gather and store field evaluation data, interface with internal and external business applications, and process customer order and billing information. This project will ensure that perishable agricultural items are more efficiently moved through the inspection process ensuring the end consumer enjoys the freshest commodities possible. The operational benefits of this project include increased efficiency and improved customer service.

## Automated Commercial Environment Collections Module

{% include project-data.html path="cbp_ace" %}

Currently, CBP’s 30-year-old collection tool, the Automated Commercial System (ACS), is housed on the agency’s last remaining mainframe solution that runs and uses 3.9 million lines of antiquated COBOL code. The current operational environment requires a modernized system to meet the demands of the CBP mission and provide the Agency with a flexible, secure platform to support the growing complexities of global trade facilitation and enforcement. An efficient and secure system will reinforce CBP’s mission to enhance legitimate trade and travel and will improve customs enforcement, revenue collections, trade protections, and access capabilities. 

Through this project, CBP will modernize the outdated ACS platform through the development of the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) Collections module. The development of the ACE Collections module will enable CBP to retire ACS, as well as decommission CBP’s last remaining mainframe solution, which supports the current tool. This project will help CBP improve customs enforcement, revenue collections, trade protections, and user experience through improved features and business capabilities, while in the long run reducing the operations and maintenance costs associated with the existing system. CBP has already begun work on this project using internal funding, and deployed the first module of the new tool, the ACE Collections Release Statements Automated Clearing House (ACH) Processing in 2019. 

Without this funding, CBP would need to continue to rely on the outdated Collections system and pay the significant costs associated with the current mainframe solution. However, with support from the TMF, the project can be conducted over four years as a single effort to replace the legacy system. By the end of this project, CBP will have a cloud-based core Collections system that will modernize both the underlying technology and the code base. CBP will also achieve operational efficiencies that will decrease its current software expenses and reduce other existing development and maintenance expenditures. CBP anticipates it will have a greater ability to serve its mission by modernizing the basic functionality of its Collections system. This modernization will make CBP’s operations more efficient, resilient, and secure, while safeguarding the Nation’s global economic competitiveness through legitimate trade to benefit the U.S. businesses and partnering government agencies.

## Data Modernization

{% include project-data.html path="dol_dm" %}

This project will modernize DOL’s enterprise data management and analytics capabilities to help improve availability and accessibility of critical DOL data to all consumers of that data – including developers, journalists, researchers, and other Federal agencies.

Currently, DOL faces data quality, consistency, and availability issues which limit the Department’s ability to use it to drive organizational performance improvements. The proposed DOL project will 1) incorporate enterprise-standard predictive analytics and reporting capabilities into the DOL IT Platform, 2) implement enterprise data management capabilities and 3) support an application programming interface (API) and public-facing data portal to transform how the DOL shares data, both internally and with the public. This project will also support DOL’s mission areas and deploy resources in a manner which maximizes organizational performance. Furthermore, this project will enable DOL to integrate duplicative data services leading to reduced operations and maintenance and human capital expenses associated with maintaining them.

Without this funding, DOL could not accelerate development of an enterprise approach to improving data quality and expanding the number of data sets available internally and to the public. However, with the support from the TMF, the project can be advanced as an enterprise initiative over two years, building an essential foundation. By the end of this project, DOL will unlock the department’s enterprise data sources, create data management capacity, and ensure timely delivery of appropriate information to the right DOL staff and customers in a secure manner. This transformation enables an evidence-based decision-making approach across enforcement, compliance, unemployment insurance and other DOL mission areas. The operational benefits of this project include cost savings, increased efficiency, and improved services for the public.
