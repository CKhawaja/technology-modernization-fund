## Phase One: Initial Project Proposal (IPP)

- **Agencies submit Initial Project Proposals (IPPs) using the IPP Template**, which are reviewed by the Technology Modernization Board.
- **The Board assesses IPPs based on the Criteria established by the Board.** The Board will provide all agencies that submit IPPs a written memo highlighting the Boardâ€™s decision and possible requesting additional action. 

The proposal template for the IPP is available in the [Documents & Templates]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/documents.md %}) section of this site.

## Phase Two: Full Project Proposal (FPP)

- **If the Board accepts an IPP, the project team presents their Full Project Proposal (FPP) to the Board.** FPPs allow the Board to review all financial aspects of the project and ask pointed questions of the project team.
- **If the Board approves an FPP for funding, the GSA program office and agency project team finalize a Written Agreement,** consistent with recommendations made by the Board. The Written Agreement acts as a contract between the agency and Board and lists specific requirements and milestones.
- **Funds are distributed to project teams in an incremental manner,** tied to performance against targets and milestones established by the Written Agreement.

All proposal templates for the FPP are available in the [Documents & Templates]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/documents.md %}) section of this site.

## Once a Project Has Been Funded

- **The Board reviews projects on a quarterly basis to ensure projects are on schedule and milestones are met.** The Board may request corrective action during quarterly reviews.  
- **Technical experts provide hands-on support to project teams** to improve team capability, troubleshoot issues, and guarantee successful execution. Experts from GSA and entities such as the U.S. Digital Service may support project teams.
- **Agencies repay the TMF over a 5 year repayment window.** The extended repayment window provides agencies with greater funding flexibility. Successful repayment to the fund also ensures the TMF can fund future modernization efforts.
