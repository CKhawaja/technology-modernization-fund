## Overview

###The TMF establishes a new funding model for Federal technology modernization solutions.

The TMF funding model allows agencies to deliver services to American public faster, better secure sensitive systems and data, and use taxpayer dollars more efficiently. Approved projects receive incremental funding and technical expertise to ensure project success. 


## How the TMF works

In FY 2018, the TMF received $100 million to fund modernization projects. The TMF is overseen by the [Technology Modernization Board]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/board.md %}) comprised of an elite group of Government IT leaders that review and recommend projects for funding. 

Agencies submit technology modernization proposals through a two-phased [approval process]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/process.md %}): 

1. **Agencies submit Initial Project Proposals (IPPs),** ([template]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/documents.md %}))which act as a low burden pre-screen to maximize the number of unique projects the Board can review.

2. **If the Board approves the IPP, project teams present their proposal to the Board in-person.** Projects selected by the Board receive incremental funding contingent on the successful execution of milestones. The TMF provides greater flexibility to agencies funding technology modernization efforts by extended payback requirements to five years.
