The Technology Modernization Fund has awarded a total of three projects across three federal agencies.

## UNISYS Mainframe Migration
### Housing and Urban Development (HUD)

This project will modernize the code base and accelerate the migration of five of HUD’s most critical business systems from an on-premise mainframe database to the cloud. Both the existing mainframe and the five COBOL-based applications are expensive to maintain and currently require functional system enhancements to be built in the antiquated mainframe environment, deepening the technical debt associated with the eventual decommissioning of the platform. 

The new modern platform will be a Java cloud-based application suite that costs less to maintain and enables functional and technical enhancements to be completed more rapidly, at lower cost. The systems on the current on-premises physical hardware environment support 30,000 users for more than 100 HUD grant, subsidy, and loan programs that disburse $27 billion per year. According to HUD estimates, the code modernization and migration will save $8 million annually, enabling payback and generating working capital to transform additional legacy systems.

Without this funding, the Department would likely not have the resources to pursue this project for several years due to funding limitations. However, with support from the Technology Modernization Fund the project is estimated to be completed in two years.

## Enterprise Cloud Email
### Department of Energy (DOE)

Like most Federal entities, DOE is facing the dual operational and financial challenge of maintaining on-premises, legacy infrastructure due to aging equipment, an increasing demand for servers, storage, and the labor necessary to operate and maintain such systems. Maintaining multiple on-premises email environments not only drives cost upward, it also increases the enterprise’s cybersecurity risks. Enterprise visibility and internal coordination of vulnerability mitigation imposes another layer of complexity compounded by the current environment and number of agency systems. 

Currently DOE operates 64 separate email systems (of which 45 are on-premises) servicing approximately 184,387 mailboxes across DOE. In FY 2018, DOE planned a limited move of 19 on-premises systems to cloud email. This project will accelerate the implementation of the DOE Enterprise Cloud Email, enabling the Department to secure large scale operational benefits and costs savings by allowing the Department to complete the consolidation, upgrade, and migration effort for the 26 remaining on-premises systems.

Without this funding, DOE would need to conduct the migration of the remaining systems using a piecemeal approach subject to fund availability. However, with support from the TMF the project can be conducted as a single effort and can be completed in three years. By the end of this project the Department will have migrated all on-premises email systems to a cloud email Software-as-a-Service. DOE anticipates it will have a greater ability to serve its mission more quickly across sites and capabilities, which will positively impact the American people. The operational benefits of this project include cost savings, increased efficiency, improved cyber posture and decreased operational risk.

## Farmers.gov Portal
### Department of Agriculture (USDA)

Farmers.gov will deliver a better and more complete Citizen Experience for America’s farmers, ranchers, conservationists, and private foresters making good on Secretary Perdue’s promise to “build a website designed with our producers in mind...and provide seamless service across our agencies.” By establishing the Farmers.gov Citizen Experience Portal, useful and critical program information that was previously scattered across numerous agency-specific websites will now be unified through a standards-based customer experience integrating modern business capabilities to ensure an intuitive experience.

In May 2017, Secretary Perdue reorganized USDA to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and customer focus by establishing the Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) mission area focused on common customers to include the Farm Service Agency, (FSA), the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the Risk Management Agency (RMA). Both FSA and NRCS provide financial and technical assistance to farmers and ranchers through related conservation programs. While separately authorized and appropriated, the programs share common customers and also share interconnected systems. Through this project, USDA will have the opportunity to update and modernize the conservation financial assistance and payment operations across FSA and NRCS. This is an opportunity to update legacy systems and re-engineer processes and systems to reduce improper payments, address and resolve repeated financial audit findings, and properly connect these agency systems to the USDA common financial system.

Without this funding, USDA would need to delay integrating this part of the process into the consolidated Farmers.gov Citizen Experience Portal in a later year when funds became available. However, with support from the TMF the project can be conducted at the same time as other enhancements to the Portal, faster. By the end of this project USDA will have completed a business process reengineering effort and four quarterly development sprints in under two years.
