## Overview

### The Technology Modernization Fund

The TMF allows agencies to borrow money to fund modern technology solutions that will improve service delivery to the public, secure sensitive systems and data, and save taxpayer dollars. Approved projects will then receive funds in an incremental manner when they successfully meet specific project milestones throughout the modernization effort.

Agencies have the opportunity to submit technology modernization proposals through a two phased approval process. The Board will approve proposals that make the best case for delivering on agency mission objectives and demonstrate the greatest likelihood of success.


## How the TMF works
The Technology Modernization Board identifies opportunities to improve or operationalize legacy IT projects, accelerate modernization efforts, and put commercial technology solutions into practice. They rigorously review agency modernization proposals and recommend select projects for funding.

The TMF provides upfront funding for modernization investments, which agencies will repay over a period of five years. Funding for all projects will be incremental and tied to the completion of agreed-upon milestones. In FY 2018, the TMF received $100 million to support modernization projects.
