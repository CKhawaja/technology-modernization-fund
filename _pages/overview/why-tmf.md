[INTRO HERE]

- **Strong Incentives.** Rigorous project submissions and competition before the Board incentivizes agencies to develop comprehensive, executable modernization proposals.
- **TMF Board.** An interdisciplinary executive-level Board of experts will only recommend a project for funding after rigorous evaluation.
- **Technical Expertise.** Approved funding is paired with technical experts in design, engineering, acquisition, and cybersecurity to help projects execute quickly and successfully.
- **Incremental Funding.** Iterative funding, tied to delivery of milestones, will allocate money as needed over time, and only when a project is able to actually produce results - transfers may be reimbursed to the TMF over a period of up to five years.
