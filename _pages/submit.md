Guidance posted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) allows agencies to submit proposals at any time. Proposals will be considered by the Board as they are submitted.

Guidelines for the American Rescue Plan Funding can be found here. Proposals sent to ofcio@omb.eop.gov by Tuesday, June 1, 2021 will receive expedited consideration.

If you intend to submit a proposal, we encourage you to notify the TMF Program Management Office at tmf@gsa.gov early so that the PMO is able to support your team through the entire TMF application and review process.


## Requirements to Submit

To submit a project to the Board for evaluation, a representative from your agency must complete an [Initial Product Proposal]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/documents.md %}) (IPP). Initial Project Proposals provide necessary information for the Board to consider a proposed project. The Initial Project Proposals should explain the concept behind the project, its projected impact on agency mission, the strength of the project team and execution strategy, and other foundational details. The proposal template for the IPP is available in the [Documents & Templates]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/documents.md %}) section of this site. 

## If You Have Questions or Need Assistance

The TMF Program Management Office (PMO), part of the General Services Administration (GSA), is here to support your team throughout the entire TMF application and submission process. We are available to help develop your initial IPP and to review your IPP prior to submission. For more information about our full suite of services or to get in touch with us, please see the [Get Help Preparing Your Submission]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/get-help.md %}) section of this site.

## Once You are Ready to Submit 

[Email your IPP](mailto:tmf@gsa.gov) to the TMF PMO. _Please include in the email the name and contact information for the primary program- or project-level Point-of-Contact (POC) for the project team._
