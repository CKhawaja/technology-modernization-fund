The Board stands by the following guiding principles to achieve the mission of the TMF:

## Serve the best interest of the American public
- Prioritize technology solutions to improve delivery of mission-critical services
- Prioritize projects than can serve as common solutions and/or inspire reuse

## Abide by an open, transparent, and fair process for evaluating project proposals
- Implement a fair evaluation process based on consistent criteria that includes a strong technical and security approach with an execution strategy led by a highly capable team
- Require agencies to articulate why they are requesting funds from the TMF and provide assurance of sound project cost and savings estimates
- Accept proposals for both types of projects:
  - New projects or ideas that require funding to get off the ground
  - Ongoing projects that need an input of funds or technical expertise to improve project execution and drive stronger results
- Publish updates, success stories, funding recommendations, and additional information that allows agencies to learn from the TMF operating model
- Operate without a perception of bias and make funding recommendations based on the merits of individual proposals

## Develop an agile project implementation process that supports the mission of the Fund
- Implement a multi-step application process to guarantee a variety of projects are considered and the Board has all information needed to make informed funding recommendations
  - _Step 1:_ Intake Initial Project Proposals based on Board-approved template
  - _Step 2:_ Work with agency sponsors who have a project that meets the acceptable threshold of evidentiary support established by the Board in order to develop a strong business case and have project leadership present their vision and execution strategy to the Board for funding recommendations
- Ensure, to the extent practicable, that technical expertise, sound project management leadership, and other necessary resources are available to project teams

## Promote the health, sustainability, and utility of the Fund
- Maintain a diverse portfolio of funded projects including those at different stages of maturity, low and high risk opportunities, and projects from different agencies
- Establish milestones to ensure projects are on schedule and most likely to succeed
- Assess Board and Fund performance on a regular basis to continuously improve processes and functions in order to ensure overall portfolio health

## Operate according to Board rules and procedures
- Ensure all rules and procedures align to the guiding principles of the Board
- Establish a confidential environment that encourages candid discussion and the presentation of different opinions that produces substantive debate and, ultimately, conclusive recommendations from a majority of the Board
