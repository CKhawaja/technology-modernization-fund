[INTRO HERE]

- **Agencies submit modernization proposals**, which are reviewed by the Technology Modernization Board.
- **Proposals with the greatest impact, strongest business case, and highest probability of success are selected** to receive funding from the TMF.
- **Funding is issued in an incremental manner**, tied to performance against previously established targets and milestones.
- **Technical experts provide hands-on support to agencies**, leveraging resources from GSA and entities such as the U.S. Digital Service to improve team capabilities and troubleshoot impediments to success.
- **Agencies repay the TMF**, which drives accountability and enables the fund to be self-sustaining, continually reinvesting resources in future projects.
