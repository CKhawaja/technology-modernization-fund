## Strong Incentives

The TMF reimagines how IT modernization projects are funded and executed. The TMF project structure provides agencies with flexibility to invest in new IT modernization projects. Many funded projects will generate savings to the agency, which can be used to return money to the Fund for future projects.

## The Technology Modernization Board

The interdisciplinary executive-level [Board]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/board.md %}) ensures projects are rigorously evaluated, best positioned for success, and take advantage of common solutions across the Federal Government.

## Technical Expertise

Approved projects can leverage technical experts in design, engineering, acquisition, and cybersecurity to enhance project teams.

## Incremental Funding

Iterative funding, tied to delivery of milestones, enables more agile and dynamic IT modernization project implementation and ensures taxpayers dollars are used effectively and efficiently.
