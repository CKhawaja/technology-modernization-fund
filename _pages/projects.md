## UNISYS Mainframe Migration

{% include project-data.html path="hud_unisys" %}

This project will modernize the code base and accelerate the migration of five of HUD’s most critical business systems from an on-premise mainframe database to the cloud. Both the existing mainframe and the five COBOL-based applications are expensive to maintain and currently require functional system enhancements to be built in the antiquated mainframe environment, deepening the technical debt associated with the eventual decommissioning of the platform.

The new modern platform will be a Java cloud-based application suite that costs less to maintain and enables functional and technical enhancements to be completed more rapidly, at lower cost. The systems on the current on-premises physical hardware environment support 30,000 users for more than 100 HUD grant, subsidy, and loan programs that disburse $27 billion per year. According to HUD estimates, the code modernization and migration will save $8 million annually, enabling payback and generating working capital to transform additional legacy systems.

The Department originally requested and was allocated $20,000,000 for this project. The Department’s decision to pursue TMF funding and the subsequent allocation of TMF funds demonstrated HUD Leadership’s strong commitment to completing this mainframe migration
initiative, and served as a catalyst inside the Department to generate buy-in for this approach. Due to the strong support for this project at all levels of the organization, HUD leadership allocated additional internal funds identified following the TMF award to the project. 

Without the support from the TMF, the Department would likely not have the resources to pursue this project for several years due to funding limitations. However, with support from the Technology Modernization Fund the project is estimated to be completed in two years. The identification of additional internal funds will allow HUD to complete this project with a lower allocation from the TMF. HUD will still achieve the full benefits of the original TMF proposal through the use of internal funds and the reduced TMF allocation, and the scope change makes available TMF resources that can be reallocated to additional project proposals.

## Enterprise Cloud Email

{% include project-data.html path="doe_email" %}

Like most Federal entities, DOE is facing the dual operational and financial challenge of maintaining on-premises, legacy infrastructure due to aging equipment, an increasing demand for servers, storage, and the labor necessary to operate and maintain such systems. Maintaining multiple on-premises email environments not only drives cost upward, it also increases the enterprise’s cybersecurity risks. Enterprise visibility and internal coordination of vulnerability mitigation imposes another layer of complexity compounded by the current environment and number of agency systems.
Before beginning this project, DOE operated 64 separate email systems (of which 45 were on-premises) that serviced approximately 184,387 mailboxes across the Department. To enhance cyber security, reduce IT management and maintenance costs, and provide employees with a more robust email platform, DOE planned a migration of its email infrastructure to the cloud. In FY 2018, DOE conducted a limited move of 6 on-premises systems to cloud email, decommissioned one system, and established internally funded migration plans for 12 additional systems. 

The Department originally requested and was allocated $15,217,096.00 to secure large-scale operational benefits and costs savings by completing the consolidation, upgrade, and migration effort for the 26 remaining on-premises systems. The Department’s decision to pursue TMF funding and the subsequent allocation of TMF funds demonstrated DOE Leadership’s strong commitment to completing this migration initiative, and served as a catalyst inside the Department to generate buy-in from DOE’s federated labs and field offices for this approach. Due to the strong support for this project at all levels of the organization, several DOE components moved forward with migration efforts using internal funding identified following the TMF award while DOE worked through a bid protest of the IT support services contract to be used for the larger migration effort, which was successfully adjudicated in favor of the Department.  DOE has also identified 2,201 mailboxes that are able to be decommissioned, rather than migrated, due to the elimination of secondary email systems and other efficiencies. In addition, two sites decided to self-fund their migrations in Spring of 2020, allowing DOE to further reduce the funding needed from the TMF to complete the project. The revised project scope is to migrate 18,560 mailboxes to the cloud at a cost of  $3,743,702.00.

Without this funding, DOE would need to conduct the migration of the remaining systems using a piecemeal approach subject to fund availability. However, with support from the TMF the project can be conducted as a single effort and can be completed in three years. By the end of this project the Department will have migrated all on-premises email systems to a cloud email Software-as-a-Service solution. DOE anticipates it will have a greater ability to serve its mission more quickly across sites and capabilities, which will positively impact the American people. The operational benefits of this project include cost savings, increased efficiency, improved cyber posture, and decreased operational risk.

The identification of additional internal funds allowed DOE to continue making progress on the goals of the original project scope during the adjudication of the bid protest. DOE will still achieve the full benefits of the original TMF proposal through the use of internal funds and the reduced TMF allocation, and the scope change makes available TMF resources that can be reallocated to additional project proposals.

## Farmers.gov Portal

{% include project-data.html path="usda_portal" %}

Farmers.gov will deliver a better and more complete Citizen Experience for America’s farmers, ranchers, conservationists, and private foresters making good on Secretary Perdue’s promise to “build a website designed with our producers in mind…and provide seamless service across our agencies.” By establishing the Farmers.gov Citizen Experience Portal, useful and critical program information that was previously scattered across numerous agency-specific websites will now be unified through a standards-based customer experience integrating modern business capabilities to ensure an intuitive experience.

In May 2017, Secretary Perdue reorganized USDA to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and customer focus by establishing the Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) mission area focused on common customers to include the Farm Service Agency, (FSA), the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the Risk Management Agency (RMA). Both FSA and NRCS provide financial and technical assistance to farmers and ranchers through related conservation programs. While separately authorized and appropriated, the programs share common customers and also share interconnected systems. 

USDA originally requested and was allocated $10,000,000.00 to update and modernize the conservation financial assistance and payment operations across FSA and NRCS. Through this project, USDA completed process documentation of the as-is and proposed to-be processes, identified and developed four Robotics Process Operations (RPA) tools to help reduce manual data entry, and developed a Proof of Concept for a Common Conservation System to test a common enrollment process for FSA and NRCS. USDA Leadership determined after reviewing the Proof of Concept for the Common Conservation System that additional process re-engineering would be required prior to further development of the technology solution for common enrollment processes for the two agencies. Because of the need for additional process re-engineering before development could continue, USDA made the decision to reduce its requested TMF allocation so as not to tie up the limited TMF resources. The scope change makes available TMF resources that can be reallocated to additional project proposals.

Without this initial funding, USDA would have delayed the development of the as-is and to-be process documentation and the development of the RPA tools and the Common Conservation System Proof of Concept for integrating enrollment processes into the consolidated Farmers.gov Citizen Experience Portal to a later year when funds became available. However, with support from the TMF, the project has been able to test assumptions, further identify alignment and differences between the policies and processes, as well as create a Proof of Concept for this important mission function. The project also demonstrated Robotic Process Automation capabilities to create process efficiencies.

## Visa Application Transformation

{% include project-data.html path="dol_visa" %}

DOL currently uses an outdated paper-based process to issue Labor Certifications to employer applicants for certain types of work visas. DOL has dedicated certification printing rooms equipped with specialized printers that use expensive blue security paper that is manually printed and mailed to employer applicants overnight. Then, the employer applicant or their representative must mail the Labor Certification along with other paperwork to the Department of Homeland Security U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) as part of their visa application. 

The proposed project will eliminate the need for the Department of Labor to mail the Labor Certification to the employer applicant and will also eliminate the need for the employer applicant to mail the Labor Certification to USCIS. The system improvements will enable the Department of Labor to issue a Labor Certification securely and electronically to employer applicants through an “E-Certification” document, similar to the electronic boarding passes issued by airlines. In addition, this project will streamline and improve data accessibility and reporting capabilities by creating a data hub at the Department of Labor to securely transmit the Labor Certification and other necessary documentation to USCIS.

Without this funding, the Department of Labor would need to maintain the use of the paper-based process until a future year. However, with support from the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF), the Department will have transitioned the Labor Certification process for all types of visas from the paper-based process in use today to a digital “E-Certification” process. DOL anticipates it will have a greater ability to serve its applicants more quickly because employer applicants will no longer need to receive their certifications through the mail and will not need to send their certifications to USCIS through the mail. The operational benefits of this project include cost savings, increased efficiency, and improved citizen-facing processes.

## Application Modernization Integrating Flexible Architectures

{% include project-data.html path="gsa_appmod" %}

Before beginning this project, GSA had 88 applications in need of modernization. The applications have cumbersome, outdated user interfaces and are difficult to connect to other systems. Through this project GSA will 1) conduct a pilot for full stack application modernizations and 2) transform a number of GSA systems that are on legacy proprietary software to open source technologies. This transformation will simplify integrations with other systems; enable greater agility, resiliency, scalability, and performance; allow GSA greater flexibility in recruiting talent; and in the long term, lower the cost of operations and improve the quality of the applications.

The applications also have a high dependency on legacy proprietary technology, which is challenging to maintain and lacks the flexibility to allow users to easily and quickly obtain the actionable information that they need compared to more modern open-source technologies. It is also challenging for GSA to recruit talented resources to work on these legacy applications. Through this project, GSA will pursue full transformation of the planned applications, including the hardware, database layer, and application layers. GSA will use a cross-functional Solutions Team that has a deep understanding of the current applications’ technical specifications and collaborates to create a set of standard target technologies to migrate towards. The Agency originally requested and was allocated $14,997,667 for this project. As part of their ongoing monitoring of the project, GSA’s leadership determined that the goals of the project to develop and test a repeatable process for modernizing legacy applications could be achieved within a reduced TMF allocation and that internal resources could be leveraged to make additional progress in modernizing legacy applications. The revised scope of the project is to modernize 12 applications at a cost below the $9,816,833.00 already transferred to the agency. Any unobligated amounts will be returned to the Fund. 

Without this funding, GSA would need to continue using these outdated applications in most instances and would only be able to pursue modernization to decouple legacy technology piecemeal as funding became available. However, with this funding, GSA will be able to pursue the modernization of a significant portion of impacted systems as a coordinated project using best in class agile methodologies. By the end of this project, GSA will have modernized a meaningful percentage of its applications that are dependent on proprietary technology, and will have generated a playbook for such modernizations that can be put to work in future GSA efforts as well as at other government agencies. GSA anticipates it will have a greater ability to service its mission by making it easier to access actionable business information and through expanding the use of more flexible open-source technologies, which will benefit the American people. The operational benefits include increased efficiency and decreased operational risk.

GSA has been able to accelerate the development of the repeatable processes for modernizing legacy applications, allowing the team to still achieve the goals of the original project scope with a reduced funding allocation. GSA has also completed 10 other modernization efforts using the same playbook. GSA will still achieve the full benefits of the original TMF proposal through the use of internal funds and the reduced TMF allocation, and the scope change makes available TMF resources that can be reallocated to additional project proposals.

## Infrastructure Optimization and Cloud Adoption

{% include project-data.html path="usda_ck10" %}

 USDA has a critical mission that is currently hampered by the use of outdated technology. The current solutions for some of its applications are riddled with system performance issues, security challenges, and a decentralized IT infrastructure that is costly to maintain and upgrade. 

The Department originally requested and was allocated $5,000,000 to migrate 10 applications from outdated, costly Mission Area-specific data centers to Cloud services, where the data center hardware is owned and maintained by the private sector vendor. USDA worked with the GSA Cloud Centers of Excellence to develop their approach and the project represented the beginning of cloud-enablement across USDA. It was intended to migrate existing applications to the cloud and consolidate cloud expertise so that it can be leveraged enterprise-wide. The Department’s decision to pursue TMF funding and the subsequent allocation of TMF funds demonstrated USDA Leadership’s strong commitment to completing this migration initiative, and served as a catalyst inside the Department to generate buy-in from USDA’s agencies and components for this approach. Due to the strong support for this project at all levels of the organization, the Food and Nutrition Service moved forward with migration efforts for five of the identified applications using internal funding identified following the TMF award. USDA also identified that a revised analysis conducted as part of the agile project management approach determined that four of the remaining proposed applications would not generate the return on investment necessary to repay the TMF through project savings. USDA reviewed its remaining application portfolio and determined that further evaluation at the agency level would be required before replacement applications could be identified and made the decision to reduce its requested TMF allocation so as not to tie up the limited TMF resources during their reevaluation process.

With the support of the TMF, USDA can complete the migration of the Emergency Watershed Protection application in the Farm Production and Conservation portfolio, improving functionality while also generating savings that can be used to repay the TMF. USDA will also use the GSA Playbook to perform additional application rationalization and discovery activities for new cloud adoption/migration customers. USDA anticipates it will have a greater ability to serve its mission, which will positively impact the American people. The operational benefits of this project include cost savings, increased efficiency, and decreased operational risk.

The identification of additional internal funds, coupled with the remaining allocation from the TMF, will allow USDA to conduct the cloud migration of six critical applications as well as conduct additional application rationalization efforts using established best practices. The scope change makes available TMF resources that can be reallocated to additional project proposals.

## NewPay Payroll and Work Schedule and Leave Management Software-as-a-Service

{% include project-data.html path="gsa_newpay" %}

Currently, most Federal payroll operations use decades-old legacy software, which is costly as well as difficult to maintain. For example, GSA’s system is housed in a data center in Kansas City, MO. The system has not had a major update in many years and is in serious need of modernization. Funds from the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) will enable GSA to complete the configuration of the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution and related interfaces for payroll and will lay the foundation for an enterprise solution for human resource functions Government-Wide.

GSA originally requested and was allocated $20,650,000.00 for this project to develop a Software-as-a-Service solution and related interfaces for both payroll and work schedule and leave management (WSLM). GSA and other agencies requested Congressional appropriations in FY 2019 and FY 2020 to conduct planning and migration activities for the current Shared Service Provider agencies to migrate to the NewPay solution. However, neither GSA nor other agencies have received the requested funding from Congress. GSA Leadership requested to reduce the scope associated with this project given the uncertain timing of agency migrations to the tool. The revised scope of the project is to configure and test the NewPay payroll solution for the planned 65 pay plans at a cost below the $16,986,021.00 already transferred to the agency. Any unobligated amounts will be returned to the Fund. The scope change makes available TMF resources that can be reallocated to additional project proposals.

Without this funding, GSA would have needed to delay establishing the cloud-enabled SaaS solution until a future year when dedicated upfront funding could be secured from the current or future user base or other sources instead of paying for the investment over a period of years. With the support from the TMF the project will be able to stand up initial payroll capabilities by the end of 2020 and have a foundational tool ready for any customers that are able to secure planning and migration funds to move to the NewPay solution in future years. By the end of this project, GSA will be better positioned to support existing Federal-wide shared service provider customers, by configuring up to 65 of the most common pay plans, including calculation of Title 5 federal payroll. GSA anticipates it will have a greater ability to serve its mission by improving its shared service offerings, which will benefit the American people by transitioning Government back office operations to modern technology, reducing costs and risk, and leveraging commercial innovation. The operational benefits of this project include laying the groundwork for elimination of costly legacy customized technology, increased efficiency, improved cyber posture and decreased operational risk.

## Charge and Case Management System Modernization

{% include project-data.html path="eeoc_casemgmt" %}

This project will accelerate the modernization of EEOC’s charge and case management system. Currently, EEOC’s charge and case management program is running on an outdated and slow backbone system that relies heavily on costly proprietary technologies and requires the use of precise alphanumeric codes, rather than plain language, to record case information for the more than 200,000 inquiries reviewed by the agency each year. This project will allow for faster, more efficient review of cases and will reduce the costs of operating the system. 

EEOC anticipates it will have a greater ability to serve its mission by improving the basic functionality of its core charge and case management system, which will not only make EEOC's private and public sector operations more efficient but also benefit the Fair Employment Practice Agencies that rely on EEOC's system to manage their cases. In addition, applicants and employees seeking assistance from EEOC will be able to take advantage of end-to-end digital processing of their charges. 

Without this funding, EEOC would need to complete this project over a period of five years. However, with the support from the TMF the project can be conducted in FY 2020 and FY 2021 as a single effort to replace the legacy system. By the end of this project, EEOC will have a modern, cloud-based core charge and case management system that will modernize both the underlying technology and achieve operational efficiencies that will decrease its current software licensing expenses and reduce other existing development and maintenance expenditures. The operational benefits of this project include increased efficiency, cost savings and improved citizen services.

## Agricultural Marketing Service Specialty Crops System Modernization

{% include project-data.html path="usda_spc" %}

This project will accelerate the modernization of the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Specialty Crops Program billing, inspection, and certificate generation and issuance processes that support the inspection and certification of more than 10.7 billion pounds of processed fruit and vegetable products and 49.9 billion pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables. This includes 1.2 billion pounds of fresh and processed fruit and vegetable items valued at more than $713 million for domestic feeding programs (school lunches) and 7,183 lots, or 410 million servings, of military combat rations at 18 processing plants nationwide and in American Samoa to ensure the quality of the military’s food components.

Currently, USDA AMS’s billing, inspection, and certificate generation and issuance processes are managed through a combination of inefficient manual, paper-based processes and legacy information technology systems that are outdated and difficult to maintain. This project will allow the Specialty Crops Inspection program to modernize its systems and processes by moving the agency to a cloud-based solution that leverages existing commercial products and offerings. Moreover, this project will facilitate a cultural transformation in the Specialty Crops Inspection program, streamlining, standardizing, and modernizing the underlying processes that support this important work.

Without this funding, USDA would need to complete this project gradually over a period of five years. However, with the support from the TMF the project can be conducted as a single effort and be completed by FY 2022. By the end of this project, USDA will have a modern, holistic system for its billing, inspection, and certificate generation and issuance processes that will enable AMS Specialty Crops inspectors, front-line managers, and other users to comprehensively and securely gather and store field evaluation data, interface with internal and external business applications, and process customer order and billing information. This project will ensure that perishable agricultural items are more efficiently moved through the inspection process ensuring the end consumer enjoys the freshest commodities possible. The operational benefits of this project include increased efficiency and improved customer service.

## Automated Commercial Environment Collections Module

{% include project-data.html path="cbp_ace" %}

Currently, CBP’s 30-year-old collection tool, the Automated Commercial System (ACS), is housed on the agency’s last remaining mainframe solution that runs and uses 3.9 million lines of antiquated COBOL code. The current operational environment requires a modernized system to meet the demands of the CBP mission and provide the Agency with a flexible, secure platform to support the growing complexities of global trade facilitation and enforcement. An efficient and secure system will reinforce CBP’s mission to enhance legitimate trade and travel and will improve customs enforcement, revenue collections, trade protections, and access capabilities. 

Through this project, CBP will modernize the outdated ACS platform through the development of the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) Collections module. The development of the ACE Collections module will enable CBP to retire ACS, as well as decommission CBP’s last remaining mainframe solution, which supports the current tool. This project will help CBP improve customs enforcement, revenue collections, trade protections, and user experience through improved features and business capabilities, while in the long run reducing the operations and maintenance costs associated with the existing system. CBP has already begun work on this project using internal funding, and deployed the first module of the new tool, the ACE Collections Release Statements Automated Clearing House (ACH) Processing in 2019. 

Without this funding, CBP would need to continue to rely on the outdated Collections system and pay the significant costs associated with the current mainframe solution. However, with support from the TMF, the project can be conducted over four years as a single effort to replace the legacy system. By the end of this project, CBP will have a cloud-based core Collections system that will modernize both the underlying technology and the code base. CBP will also achieve operational efficiencies that will decrease its current software expenses and reduce other existing development and maintenance expenditures. CBP anticipates it will have a greater ability to serve its mission by modernizing the basic functionality of its Collections system. This modernization will make CBP’s operations more efficient, resilient, and secure, while safeguarding the Nation’s global economic competitiveness through legitimate trade to benefit the U.S. businesses and partnering government agencies.
