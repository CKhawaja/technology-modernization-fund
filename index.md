deck: 'The Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) was authorized by the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017. The TMF creates an innovative funding vehicle that gives agencies additional ways to deliver services to the American public more quickly, better secure sensitive systems and data, and use taxpayer dollars more efficiently.'

Approved projects receive incremental funding and technical expertise to ensure project success. In Fiscal Year 2018, the TMF received $100 million to fund modernization projects.

## How the TMF works

The TMF is overseen by the [Technology Modernization Board]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/board.md %}), comprised of Government IT leaders representing deep skills in technology, transformation, and operations, who review and recommend projects for funding. Agencies submit technology modernization proposals to the Board through a [two-phased approval process]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/process.md %}):

### Phase One: Initial Project Proposal (IPP)
Agencies submit Initial Project Proposals (IPPs), which act as a low burden pre-screen to maximize the number of unique projects the Board can review. 

### Phase Two: Full Project Proposal (FPP)
If the Board approves an IPP, the project team team submits their Full Project Proposal (FPP) to the Board. Teams are also expected to present to the Board in-person. 

Projects selected by the Board receive incremental funding contingent on the successful execution of milestones. The TMF provides greater flexibility to agencies funding technology modernization efforts by extended payback requirements to five years.

Proposal templates for both phases are available in the [Documents & Templates]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/documents.md %}) section of this site.
