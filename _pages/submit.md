Guidance posted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) allows agencies to submit proposals at any time. We encourage _all_ federal agencies to submit project proposals if the vision, mission, and use of TMF makes sense for agency IT modernization efforts. Proposals will be considered by the Board as they are submitted.

To submit a project to the Board for evaluation, a representative from your agency must complete an [Initial Product Proposal]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/documents.md %}) (IPP). Initial Project Proposals provide necessary information for the Board to consider a proposed project. The Initial Project Proposals should explain the concept behind the project, its projected impact on agency mission, the strength of the project team and execution strategy, and other foundational details.

**Once you are ready to submit,** [email your proposal](mailto:tmf@gsa.gov) to the TMF Program Office.
