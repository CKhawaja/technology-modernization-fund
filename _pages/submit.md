Guidance posted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) allows agencies to submit proposals at any time. We encourage ALL federal agencies to submit project proposals if the vision, mission, and use of TMF makes sense for agency IT modernization efforts. Proposals will be considered by the Board as they are submitted.

To submit a project to the Board for evaluation, a representative from your agency must complete an Initial Project Proposal (IPP). Initial Project Proposals provide necessary information for the Board to consider a proposed project. Initial Project Proposals should explain the concept behind the project, its projected impact on agency mission, the strength of the project team and execution strategy, and other foundational details.

Agencies are encouraged to review the subject areas below to become familiar with the types of questions and concerns the Board is most likely to raise.
