## Technology Modernization Fund: Customer Experience Portfolio Technical Leads

The Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) is hiring for the role of GS-15 Technical Leads for the [Customer Experience Portfolio](tmf.cio.gov/cx). Technical Leads are crucial to helping the government invest over $1 billion in funding (including through the American Rescue Plan) to modernize government systems. This is an opportunity to make a huge difference in the lives of the public. This page contains a high-level summary of the roles we are trying to fill. 

### Opportunity overview

These opportunities are located in the General Services Administration (GSA), Office of the Deputy Administrator, Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) Program Management Office (PMO). The TMF works closely with the TMF Board, GSA leadership, and agency teams to build and evaluate sound business cases for modernization investments, and provide technical advice and assistance throughout project execution. We help agencies make their services more accessible, efficient, and effective through strategic technical project investments and following modern software development best practices. 

#### Role summary
